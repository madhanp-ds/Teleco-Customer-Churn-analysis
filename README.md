# telecom-customer-churn-analysis
End-to-end analysis and machine learning on telecom customer data to identify churn drivers and predict customer churn.
## Overview
This project performs exploratory data analysis and builds machine learning
models to understand and predict customer churn in a telecom company.

## Dataset
Telecom customer data containing demographics, service usage, and billing information.

## Notebooks
- 01_data_analysis.ipynb → Data cleaning, EDA, and key insights
- 02_machine_learning.ipynb → Feature engineering, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree models

## Key Insights
- Higher churn among month-to-month contract customers
- Customers with shorter tenure show higher churn risk
- High monthly charges are strongly associated with churn

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression (baseline model)
- Decision Tree (interpretable model)

## Tools
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
